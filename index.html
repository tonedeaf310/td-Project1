        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I'm a native Floridian born in Miami and currently living in Jacksonville with my wife, son and three dogs. They certainly keep me busy, but I wouldn't have it any other way! I currently work full time in the insurance industry, but I am ready to make a change and begin working in tech.</p>
        <p>I have been building sites in my spare time off-and-on since I was 13 years old. They were terrible things with tiled animated Gifs as the background. Yuck! I still don't claim to have an eye for design, but I think I'm getting a bit better lately. Please let me know what you think in Slack or through the social media links in the footer.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I look forward to learning and polishing my skills in the following arenas:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>WordPress</li>
          <li>Java</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I bring a competitive nature and an appetite for excellence to any task I set before myself. I look forward to developing my programming skills.</p>

        <h2>Early Years</h2>
        <p>I started writing HTML before CSS really came onto the scene, before the days of Chrome, Firefox, or Safari. The choices back then were Netscape or IE. If you were unfortunate enough to still be on dial-up (most were) you might have been on AOL.</p>
        <p>That makes me sound like an old fogie. "These kids don't know how good they have it! We were lucky to get 3 images on a page and they would load slowly even then!" I'm not kidding about that, either! In my first book about HTML it listed the pros and cons of Jpeg vs Gif and one of the pros for Jpeg was that it would load progressively, so visitors to your site could at least see a blurry version of the image until the transfer finished!</p>
        <p>I built a site on Geocities (Archive.org was not able to save it) in middle school, then built a site with Chuck Norris-like facts about our RA in college. Then I got caught up in work after college and basically stopped developing my web skills.</p>

        <h2>Day Job</h2>
        <p>Since 2010, I have been working as a field supervisor for a major car insurance company. It's a tough job because you have to spend a lot of time dealing with unhappy customers, simply because their cars have been damaged, and the last place anyone wants to be on any given day is talking to a representative of their insurance company about the repairs. I also spend a ton of time analyzing my team's results using Excel, Access, and a bevy of online reporting tools made available by the company.</p>
        <p>I have minimal interaction with my boss, so I mostly have to develop my own reporting to share results with my team. As a result, I have become extremely well versed with MS Excel and its functions. Since I was developing my own reports, I became quite adept with formulas and realized I relished the challenge of coming up with an elegant formula for handling the proiblems I was trying to solve. It dawned on me that the real job I should be doing is finding elegant, creative solutions to problems, and decided to start down this path.</p>

        <h2>Back in the Swing</h2>
        <p>I decided to get in contact with a friend of mine who is a developer and ask for his advice in how I should go about learning to code. I had a nebulous concept of what that might mean at the time but he put me on track to check out Treehouse. Turns out, he used to work for Treehouse! I started taking classes in the middle of 2015 and I'm greatly enjoying it so far!</p>
        <p>Here's to the start of a great career!</p>
